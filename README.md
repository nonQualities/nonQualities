#### about me 
I am extremely passionate about the foundations of Computation, Computing Systems, and Datalogi, underpinned by a profound appreciation for the mathematical and physical sciences. I operate on the conviction that the advancement of computing shouldn't occur in isolation; rather, it must be a multidisciplinary synthesis. Consequently, my academic inquiries extend beyond the algorithmic into Economics, Philosophy, Linguistics, and Psychology(last three without any formal degrees) , seeking to understand the socio-cognitive frameworks within which technical systems operate. I intend to positively contribute to the fields both intellectually and also, in terms of advancements and accessibility.
