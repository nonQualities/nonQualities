## নমস্কাৰ (That's Hello)
You could describe me as just another tier-three college kid who likes to code. I should have started in the 1990s, but I was born four years into the new millennium and took another 20 years to start coding. Nevertheless, I am here now, new but eager. I hope to update this readme with crazy stuff to boast about soon. Work in progress.
